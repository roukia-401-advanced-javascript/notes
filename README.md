 - ***Mongo database***
 
  MongoDB is a NoSQL Database (Document Store) server
  
  *Linux and Windows Users*
  
   - Run these commands, in order, to install MongoDB. Note that for this installation
    
    `wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc | sudo apt-key add -`
    `sudo apt-get install gnupg`
    `echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list`
    `sudo apt-get update`
    `sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org`
    
   - After installation completes, we’ll need to setup MongoDB as a “service” so that it can easily be restarted. Enter the following commands, in order, to set this up:
    
    `sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/mongo/master/debian/init.d -o /etc/init.d/mongod`
    `sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/mongod`
    `sudo service mongod start`
    
   - Now, let’s make sure we can connect to the MongoDB server. Run this command:
    
    `mongo`
    
   - Type exit to return to your bash shell. MongoDB is successfully installed.
